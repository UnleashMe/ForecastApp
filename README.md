## Content

The task for this app was to show a list of weather forecast for 5 days in an city (I chose Saint-Petersburg) and for every day list displays description, icon, temperature, wind speed and humidity.

## How it works

All data in this app is provided by https://www.weatherapi.com. When app launches, it fetches weather information from Api and displays it as a list. App also supports dark theme and different screen sizes.
